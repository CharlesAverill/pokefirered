 * The meat of the menu code lives in this file. The tutorial comments assume the following:
 *
 * 1) You understand the basics of GBA graphics i.e. the multiple BG layers and how they are controlled, the various
 *    GBA graphics modes, the basics of hardware sprites, etc
 *
 * 2) You are familiar with the concept of tiles (tilesets) vs tilemaps. These are two distinct concepts and you need to
 *    understand them to understand any UI code.
 *
 * 3) You are familiar with the concept of a charblock and a screenblock, which are crucial to proper VRAM layout.
 *
 * 4) You understand the basics of the pokeemerald Callback and Task systems, which structure the menu's control flow.
 *
 * 5) You have a basic grasp of the GBA memory layout -- you know the difference between VRAM, EWRAM, IWRAM, etc.
 *
 * 6) Some of the UI code makes use of DMA (Direct Memory Access). This assumes you are familiar with what DMA is and
 *    how it works on the GBA. Also note that a lot of the GF library code does not perform DMA directly, rather it
 *    schedules a DMA copy to occur during the next VBlank using a circle buffer of DMA transfer request objects. See
 *    the code in `gflib/dma3_manager.{h,c} for more details.

/*
 * Basic Code Flow
 * A summary of the basic control flow path for this code. This may help aid in understanding which functions get
 * called, and when.
 *
 * 1) Any code that would like to launch this menu must include `sample_ui.h' so it has the right hook-in, specifically
 *    `Task_OpenSampleUi_Simple'. It must then setup the transition (however is relevant based on its context) and set
 *    the active task to `Task_OpenSampleUi_Simple'. In our case, `start_menu.c' is the caller of this task.
 *
 * 2) `Task_OpenSampleUi_Simple' waits for any active fades to finish, then it calls our init code in `SampleUi_Init'
 *    which changes the gMainCallback2 to our `SampleUi_SetupCB'.
 *
 * 3) `SampleUi_SetupCB' runs each frame, bit-by-bit getting our menu initialized. Once initialization has finished,
 *    this callback:
 *       1) Sets up a new task `Task_SampleUiWaitFadeIn' which waits until we fade back in before hotswapping itself for
 *          `Task_SampleUiMainInput' which reads input and updates the menu state.
 *       2) Starts a palette fade to bring the screen from black back to regular colors
 *       3) Sets our VBlank callback to `SampleUi_VBlankCB' (which is called every VBlank as part of the VBlank
 *          interrupt service routine). This callback transfers our OAM and palette buffers into VRAM, among other
 *          things
 *       4) Sets gMainCallback2 to our menu's main callback `SampleUi_MainCB', which does the standard processing of
 *          tasks, animating of sprites, etc.
 *
 * 4) We have reached our standard menu state. Every frame `SampleUi_MainCB' runs, which calls `Task_SampleUiMainInput`
 *    to get input from the user and update menu state and backing graphics buffers. `SampleUi_MainCB' also updates
 *    other important gamestate. Then, when VBlank occurs, our `SampleUi_VBlankCB' copies palettes and OAM into VRAM
 *    before pending DMA transfers fire and copy any screen graphics updates into VRAM.

 * Like the above BgTemplates, WindowTemplates are just an easy way to setup some software windows (which are provided
 * by the GameFreak library). GF's window system is used primarily for drawing dynamic text on the background layers.
 * Their inner workings are quite confusing, so hopefully this tutorial clears some things up.
 *
 * One big thing to note is that GF windows use a technique called tile rendering to draw text. With normal BG
 * rendering, you have a pre-drawn tileset, and then you dynamically update the tilemap, based on gamestate, to change
 * what's shown on screen. With tile rendering, this process is basically flipped on its head. GF tile-rendered windows
 * instead write a preset increasing sequence of tile indexes into the parts of the BG tilemap that represent a given
 * window. Then, to draw text, it dynamically draws to a backing pixel buffer (the `u8 *tileData' in the Window struct)
 * that is copied into VRAM just like regular tile data. This effectively allows the text rendering code to treat the
 * window BG as a pseudo-framebuffer, as if we were in a simple bitmap mode like Mode 3. This technique is advantageous
 * because it allows for maximum flexibility with font sizing and spacing. You aren't locked into 8x8 tiles for each
 * character.
 *
 * For more information about tile rendering and text rendering sytems in general, check out the TTE TONC tutorial and
 * the tile rendering section specifically. You can also consult Game Freak's code in `gflib/window.c' and
 * `gflib/text.c'.

         * windows into the same BG, we need to tell the engine where exactly to place each window's graphics, lest they
         * overlap.
         *
         * Typically, you want each subsequent window's baseBlock to be at least:
         *     previousBaseBlock + (prevWindowWidth * prevWindowHeight)
         * which makes sense if you think about it. (Try changing the second window's baseBlock to see how important
         * this parameter is!)

         * And another thing -- why is this value set to 1 and not 0? You will understand this better once you finish
         * going through the tutorial code, but I will put the explanation here:
         *
         * It's because this window lives on BG0. If we set the baseBlock to 0, then the text writing code will draw the
         * first section of window text into tile 0 of charblock 0 (because baseBlock=0 and BG0_charblock=0). When we
         * init our window, BG0's tilemap buffer is zeroed out (because it gets AllocZeroed'd by the window init code).
         * But since the tilemap buffer ultimately gets copied into BG0's screenblock, it is effectively telling the
         * hardware to draw tile 0 across the entire screen. And since we put some text in tile 0, you are going to end
         * up seeing a small bit of text drawn across the screen, which looks really bad.
         *
         * We obviously don't want that, so we offset the window text by one so that tile 0 of charblock 0 is empty. And
         * as a result our zeroed BG tilemap draws transparent tiles instead of the text fragment. (Recall that the
         * value in each tilemap buffer entry is basically a pointer into our charblock, so `tilemapBuffer[i] == 0'
         * means draw `tile 0' onto wherever `tilemap position i' maps on the LCD. The various LCD register settings
         * will define where on the LCD that `tilemap position i' is actually drawn. And technically, it's actually a
         * tad more complicated than this. See here for details: https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/regbg.htm#sec-map)
         *
         * If this is confusing, try changing this value to 0, rebuild and see what the menu does. Looking at the mGBA
         * tile viewer will illuminate what is happening.
