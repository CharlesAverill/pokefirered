## Roaming Pokémon

After becoming Champion, talk to Eunice in Fuchsia City.
Eunice will tell you about rumors of various roaming Pokémon.
The next roamer will start once your Pokédex shows you’ve caught the current one.
When a roamer is active, NPCs will appear around good roamer-farming routes to tell you the current location.

Here’s the order:

* Entei (no longer knows Roar)
* Lati[o|a]s
* Raikou (no longer knows Roar)
* Lati[a|o]s
* Suicune
