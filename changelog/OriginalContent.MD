## Roaming Pokemon
After becoming Champion, talk to Eunice in Fuchsia City.
Eunice will tell you about rumors of various roaming
pokemon. The next roamer will start once your Pokedex shows you've caught the current roamer.
When a roamer is active, NPCs will show up around good roamer-farming routes. They'll tell you the current location of the roamer (that way you don't have to use the Dex)
Here's the order:
- Entei
- Latias
- Raikou
- Latios
- Suicune

P.S. - Roamers reinitialize if you kill them and Entei and Raikou no longer know Roar
