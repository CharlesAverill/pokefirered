# Encounter Changes
## LeafGreen Exclusives
All LeafGreen exclusive pokemon can be found in their original LeafGreen 
[locations](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game-exclusive_Pok%C3%A9mon#Kanto). LeafGreen pokemon are *slightly*
rarer than in their host game, but for the most part it is roughly the same.
## Game Corner Changes
All Game Corner pokemon have had their level set to the max between versions, and given a useful item. Pinsir is 
available in this Game Corner.
